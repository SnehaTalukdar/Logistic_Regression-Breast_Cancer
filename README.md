# Classification of Breast Cancer Using Logistic Regression
-> Using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset from Scikit-learn, this project uses logistic regression to categorize breast cancer tumors as either malignant or benign.



## Overview

- When the target variable is binary, the supervised classification algorithm known as logistic regression is employed. This project uses medical diagnostic data to determine if a tumor is malignant. 
- A number of performance metrics and visual aids, including the sigmoid activation curve, ROC curve, and confusion matrix, are used to assess the model.

##  Dataset used

- Source : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data


## Methods

1. Data Loading - Using `load_breast_cancer()` to load the dataset from `sklearn.datasets`.

2. Data Preprocessing - Converted to a Pandas DataFrame and examined for any missing values
   Divide the data into training and testing sets (80/20 split).

3. Model Building - LogisticRegression()` is used to create a logistic regression model that is trained on training data and makes predictions on test data.

4. Evaluation Metrics -  Classification Report, Confusion Matrix (Precision, Recall, F1-score, Accuracy)
   - Sigmoid Activation Curve - ROC-AUC Curve - Custom threshold experiment.


 ##  Graphs

 Graph                      Description  
 -> Confusion Matrix   -    True V/S Predicted classes
               
 -> ROC Curve          -    AUC: Area under curve â€“ model performance

 -> Sigmoid Activation -    Logistic function visualization.
         

- Each graph is generated by using Matplotlib and appears in a separate pop-up window during code execution.
